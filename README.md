[LAB 3](https://github.com/Sope617/Github-Assignment-/blob/gh-pages/s24magd150lab03_Xiong/sketch.js) - In Lab 3 we used variables which would determine the different values of different things. Using the mouse X and Mouse Y terms also makes the object movable with the mouse and objects are able to move just on their own. 
[LAB 4](https://github.com/Sope617/Github-Assignment-/blob/gh-pages/s24magd150lab04_Xiong/sketch.js) - In Lab 4 we used many different lines of code like making different shapes. We also learned new code that would change the color of a shape if the mouse or key is pressed over it. Numbers are also used for the positioning and the color fill of the shapes. 
[LAB 7](https://github.com/Sope617/Github-Assignment-/blob/gh-pages/s24magd150lab07_Xiong/sketch.js)- In Lab 7 we made clovers in different colors and used code to make it repeat over and over again in different patterns. We also used a new method called Class where it would helps us do things to every single clover instead of doing them one by one. 
[LAB 8](https://github.com/Sope617/Github-Assignment-/blob/gh-pages/s24magd150_lab08_Xiong/sketch.js) - In Lab 8 we made a movie poster in different colors. We loaded different images and fonts. We also learned how to move words by themselves and learned how to repeat the process without pressing anything. 
[LAB 9](https://github.com/Sope617/Github-Assignment-/blob/gh-pages/s24magd150lab09_Xiong%20(1)/s24magd150lab09_Xiong/sketch.js) - In Lab 9 we learned how to implement videos and load sound into our canvas. We learned how to make a button that could play the video and turn the volume of the sounds in the background.
