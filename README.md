LAB 3 - In Lab 3 we used variables which would determine the different values of different things. Using the mouse X and Mouse Y terms also makes the object movable with the mouse and objects are able to move just on their own. 
LAB 4 - In Lab 4 we used many different lines of code like making different shapes. We also learned new code that would change the color of a shape if the mouse or key is pressed over it. Numbers are also used for the positioning and the color fill of the shapes. 
LAB 7 - In Lab 4 we made clovers in different colors and used code to make it repeat over and over again in different patterns. We also used a new method called Class where it would helps us do things to every single clover instead of doing them one by one. 
Lab 8 - In Lab 8 we made a movie poster in different colors. We loaded different images and fonts. We also learned how to move words by themselves and learned how to repeat the process without pressing anything. 
Lab 9 - We learned how to implement videos and load sound into our canvas. We learned how to make a button that could play the video and turn the volume of the sounds in the background.
